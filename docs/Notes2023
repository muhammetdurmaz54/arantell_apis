config_extrcator/configurator.py(for react app)
config_extractor/extract_config_new.pay(processing and inserting configurator excel sheet)
dd_extractor/extractor_new(historical raw data insertion)
dd_extractor/daily_extractor(frontend daily raw data insertion)
dd_processor/daily_maindbthree.py(maind db process for fronternd)
dd_processor/maindb_three.py(maindb process for historical data)

these are main files of each folder other files are inherited/called inside these files
Above functions are implemented in following files
maindbthree/dailymaindbthree (maindb process) from dd_processor folder, extractornew/dailyextractor from dd_extractor folder and extractconfignew from configextractor folder

processors/config_extractor/extract_config_new.py
	configurator excel file is read and stored in mongodb. this is the file that contains all info of ship static and formulas type of data,
	all identifiers, its limits, source identifiers groups etc.



processors/dd_extractor/extractor_new.py  and processors/dd_extractor/daily_extractor.py
	extractor_new.py is for historical data and daily_extractor is for daily inputs through frontend. this contains reading historical,
	 data(both nav and eng) and stores raw data in mongodb. reading is done through all identifiers and its source identifiers available 
	through configurator that is inserted in mongodb previously in extract_config_new.py. this process inserts only raw data, no processing is done here.


processors/dd_processor/maindb_three.py  and  processors/dd_processor/daily_maindbthree.py
	maindb_three.py is for historical data and daily_maindbthree is for daily inputs through frontend. This reads from daily raw data inserted previously 
	and calculations are done with respect to formulas hardcoded and available in configurator for derived identifiers. Outliers ML predictions spe ewma etc is calculated here.
	


extract_config_new and extractor_new/daily_extractor does not have any extra files inherited but maindb_three/daily_maindbthree has multiple files called int it.
all three fiules have the sequence of fucntion calling at bottom of its code
